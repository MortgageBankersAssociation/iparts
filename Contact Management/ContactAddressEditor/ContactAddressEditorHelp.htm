				Postal addresses entered through this iPart are automatically uploaded to 
                a service that verifies and standardizes the address. Users can then either 
                accept the suggested address or keep the original, as they entered it.</li>
            <li class="v10only"> 
				When creating a new address, users can select what type of address they are 
                creating. The <b>Purpose</b> dropdown list includes the three primary address 
                types set up in iMIS Desktop from <b>Customers &gt; Set up module &gt; General &gt; 
                Address and Notes</b> and any additional address types created from the <b>
                ADDRESS_PURPOSE</b> general lookup/validation table. Note that users can only 
                select the <b>Preferred</b> address options (<b>Mailing</b>, <b>Shipping</b>, <b>
                Billing</b>) for the three primary address types. </li>
            <li class="v10only"> 
				A <b>Status</b> field is displayed in the iPart if you have set up values in the
                <b>BAD_ADDRESS</b> validation table. This allows you to mark addresses with 
                codes such as <i>Moved</i> or <i>Invalid</i>. </li>
