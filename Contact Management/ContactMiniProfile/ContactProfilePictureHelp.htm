                <li class="v10only"><b>Display for authorized users only -</b> (enabled by default)
                    Hides the iPart from public users when accessing data for another person, which
                    prevents spoofing (changing the ID in the URL to access another&#39;s data). Disable
                    this option if you need to make this iPart visible to public users, such as for
                    a public profile. </li>

                    Hides the iPart from public users when accessing data for another person, which
                    prevents spoofing (changing the ID in the URL to access another&#39;s data). Disable
                    this option if you need to make this iPart visible to public users, such as for
                    a public profile. <b>Note:</b> This iPart may behave differently if you have edited
                    the permissions defined in your <i>ClaimsMap.xml</i> and <i>ClaimTemplates.xml</i>
                    files. By default, only System Administrators and members of the Staff Group have
                    the claims to access data for any user in the system. </li>

					<strong>Allow picture change and removal</strong> - Select this option to allow users to 
                    add, change or remove profile pictures.<ul>
                        <li><b>Prompt for Facebook connection</b> - When enabled, contacts that edit their 
                            profile picture are prompted to connect to Facebook, so that they can use their 
                            Facebook profile picture in iMIS. To use this feature, you must 
                            create a Facebook app so that your website can connect to Facebook. See the 
                            Helpsite section on creating a Facebook connection for more information.</li>

                <li>
					<strong>File types</strong> - Enter the graphics file types that may be 
                    uploaded. The default values are .GIF, .JPG, .PNG, and .BMP (widest use for

                    allowable file types, separated by commas.
