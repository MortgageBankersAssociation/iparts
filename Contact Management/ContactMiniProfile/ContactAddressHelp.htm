				<li><strong>Name</strong> - Enter a name for the content item. This text appears during design mode (configuration).</li>
                <li><strong>Title</strong> - Enter the text to display above this iPart on the rendered page. If blank, no title displays.</li>

                <li><strong>Do not render in design mode</strong> - Select this option to prevent content record data from being loaded 
                in the content editor. This improves performance during design time (configuration).</li>
                <li><strong>iPart CSS class</strong> - (optional) Enter the name of a CSS class that 
                    will be applied to the iPart at runtime. Add this CSS class to an appropriate 
                    style sheet. Using such classes lets you apply special formatting to targeted 
                    iParts in a reusable way. </li>

                <li><strong>Display a border around this content</strong> - Select this option to display a border around this iPart on the 
                rendered page.</li>
                <li><strong>Display content within a collapsible panel</strong> - Enable to allow users to minimize 
                the panel within the page, to work with dense pages more efficiently.</li>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Show the content as collapsed </strong>- Enable to display the panel minimized by default. 
                <br /><i>Tip:</i> Be sure that the <strong>Title</strong> makes clear what data is hidden from view.</li>
                </ul>

                    Hides the iPart from public users when accessing data for another person, which
                    prevents spoofing (changing the ID in the URL to access another&#39;s data). Disable
                    this option if you need to make this iPart visible to public users, such as for
                    a public profile. </li>

                    the permissions defined in your <i>ClaimsMap.xml</i> and <i>ClaimTemplates.xml</i>
                    files. By default, only System Administrators and members of the Staff Group have
                    the claims to access data for any user in the system. </li>

                contact. By default this includes address types such as Preferred Mailing, 
                Billing, and Shipping, but you can also display any address types you have
