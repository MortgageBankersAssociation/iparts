            during design mode (configuration). </li>
        <li><strong>Title</strong> - Enter the text to display above this iPart on the

        <li><strong>Do not render in design mode</strong> - Select this option to prevent

            display a border around this iPart on the rendered page. </li>

            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Include suffix</strong> - Select this option to display the Suffix field.</li>
        <li><strong>Include phone</strong> - Select this option to display the Phone field.</li>
        <li><strong>Require address</strong> - (required when creating accounts for commerce)
            Select this option to display the Address fields. When enabled, a user must enter
            their address information to create an account. If selected, the following options
            also apply:<ul>
                <li><strong>Multiple address lines</strong> - Select this option to display three 
                    Street address lines. If disabled, only a single line is displayed for the 
                    Street address. </li>
                <li class="v10only"><b>Single text address</b> - When enabled, a single address entry field is 
                    displayed for users in the U.S., so that they can enter their Street Address, 
                    City, State, and Zip code in a single text block. After submitting the address, 
                    the address verification service parses the entry and stores the values in the 
                    appropriate fields. <i>Note</i>: The <b>Multiple address lines</b> option 
                    affects how the Street Address portion is broken down. If enabled, long 
                    addresses may be stored in multiple lines. If disabled, long addresses are 
                    stored in a single Street Address field.</li>
                <li><strong>Create address purpose</strong> - Select the address purpose to which the

        </li>
        <li><strong>Include Log On link</strong> - Select this option to display a <strong>Log
            On</strong> link for users who are already registered. This link will only display
            when no user is currently logged in. </li>
        <li><strong>Include option to create logon</strong> - Select this option to allow users
            to create a logon and password at the same time they create their account. If selected,
            the following options also apply:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Require user to create logon</strong> - Select this option to require the
                    user to enter a logon and password.</li>
                <li><strong>Use email as logon</strong> - Select this option to set the logon as the
                    user&#39;s email address. The user is prompted to confirm their email
                    address when creating an account. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Commit sequence</strong> - Allows you to explicitly define the execution
            order of multiple iParts in a content record. The number in this field indicates
            the processing order for this iPart, relative to the other iParts in the same content
            record. The value must be 0 or greater. You can leave the default value of 0 if
            the execution order of iParts is not a concern. iParts with a value of 0 are processed
            <em>after</em> any other iParts with a non-zero <strong>Commit sequence</strong> value
            that are on the same content record. </li>
    </ul>
<p>
    <b>Notes</b></p>
<ul>
        <li>Postal addresses entered through this iPart are automatically uploaded to 
    a service that verifies and standardizes the address. Users can then either 
    accept the suggested address or keep the original, as they entered it.</li>
        <li class="v10only">When adding this iPart to a content record, keep the following notes in mind:
            <ul>
                <li>To use this iPart, you must enable the <b>Auto Assign Member Number </b>option from 
                    <b>iMIS Desktop &gt; Set up module &gt; General &gt; Basic Options</b>. </li>
                <li>The address purposes available in this iPart are based on the <b>ADDRESS_PURPOSE
                    </b>table defined in <b>iMIS Desktop &gt; Customers &gt; Set up tables &gt; General 
                    lookup/validation</b>. </li>
                <li>You can select the default <b>Customer Type </b>to use for new contacts created in this 
                    iPart from <b>System Setup &gt; Set up web components &gt; Quick setup</b>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="v100only">When adding this iPart to a content record, keep the following notes in mind:
            <ul>
                <li>Configuration of the password policy for the application is specified in the
                    <b>&lt;system.web&gt;&lt;membership&gt;</b> section in the <b>web.config</b> file. </li>
                <li>Only inline editable iParts follow the <b>Commit Sequence</b>. The Contact Account 
                    Creator is an inline editable iPart. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="v10only">The Contact Account Creator is required when you set up a donation page
            that processes payments immediately (instead of through the cart). Processing a
            donation immediately requires that multiple iParts are defined in a single content
            record. It does not matter the order in which the iParts are defined on the page.
            In the scenario outlined below, where the Donation Creator is the first iPart displayed
            on the page and the Submit Order Button Link is the last iPart displayed, the <b>Commit
                sequence </b>value controls the order in which the iParts are processed. When
            the donation is &quot;submitted&quot; from the content record, execution control
            is given to each iPart based on the <b>Commit sequence</b> value shown in parentheses:
            <ul>
                <li>Donation Creator (2) </li>
                <li>Contact Account Creator (1) </li>
                <li>Submit Order Button Link (3) </li>
                <li>Payment Creator (4 or 0) </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
