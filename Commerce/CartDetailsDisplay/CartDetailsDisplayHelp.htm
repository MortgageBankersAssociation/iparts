		<h1>Cart Details Display</h1>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Name - </strong>Enter a name for the content item. 
                This text appears during design mode (configuration).</li>
                <li><strong>Title - </strong>Enter the text to display above this 
                iPart on the rendered page. If blank, no title displays.</li>
                <li><strong>Do not render in design mode</strong> - Select this option 
                to prevent content record data from being loaded in the content editor. 
                This improves performance during design time (configuration).</li>
                <li><strong>iPart CSS class - </strong>(optional) Enter the name of a CSS class that 
                    will be applied to the iPart at runtime. Add this CSS class to an appropriate 
                    style sheet. Using such classes lets you apply special formatting to targeted 
                    iParts in a reusable way. </li>
                <li><strong>Display a border around this content - </strong>Select 
                this option to display a border around this iPart on the rendered page.</li>
                <li><strong>Display content within a collapsible panel - </strong>Enable 
                to allow users to minimize the panel within the page, to work with dense pages more efficiently.
                    <ul><li><strong>Show the content as collapsed - </strong>Enable to display the panel minimized by default.<br />
                            <em>Tip: </em>Be sure that the <strong>Title</strong> above makes clear what data is hidden from view.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <!-- PBI 26211 will remove these: As a user configuring my shopping cart, 
                I want the CartDetailsDisplay config to hide its confusing item linking options 
                so that my cart just links appropriately where it can and shows plain text where it cannot. -->

                <li><strong>Item details content - </strong>Specifies which content record to 
                    display when a user clicks a product item&#39;s link in their cart. The system uses
                    <strong>Product_Display</strong>; if you remove it and specify no 
                    content record (or it cannot be found), the item&#39;s name displays as plain text.</li>
                <li><strong>Event details content - </strong>Specifies which content record to 
                    display when a user clicks an event item&#39;s link in their cart. The system uses
                    <strong>Event_Display</strong>; if you remove it and specify no 
                    content record (or it cannot be found), the item&#39;s name displays as plain text. </li>

			</ul>
			<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
			<ul>
			    <li>When an unauthenticated user logs in, the cart item total might increase. This 
                    is because the cart merges the currently selected items with the user&#39;s 
                    pre-existing cart.</li>
			<li>If there is insufficient stock to fill the order, users are prompted to reduce the quantity 
			up to the current maximum. For items that are not available, an out-of-stock message 
                displays.</li>
			<li>Each item&#39;s title is a link to its product details page. This allows users to view
			item details, if configured, and to add more items to the cart.</li>
            <li class="v100only">The ID that the iPart uses and displays depends on the context:<ul>
                <li>If a URL containing a <strong>ContactKey</strong> is provided, it loads that 
                    contact&#39;s information.</li>
                <li>If no URL is provided and an <strong>On Behalf Of</strong> contact is selected, 
                    it loads the <strong>On Behalf Of</strong> contact&#39;s information.</li>
                <li>If no URL is provided and no <strong>On Behalf Of</strong> contact is selected, 
                    it loads the signed in user&#39;s information.</li>
                <li>If the user is not signed in, it displays limited information.</li>
                </ul>
