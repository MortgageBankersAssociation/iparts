		<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Shipping method options depend on the address to which the item is to be 
                    shipped. If an address is for a country for which no default ship method set has 
                    been indicated, then a message will appear that &#39;You cannot ship to this 
                    country.&#39;</li>
                <li>The Shipping Method Selector iPart uses the Address Selector iPart to provide 
                    the functionality for selecting and adding shipping addresses.<br />
    				The <strong>Manage addresses</strong> link on the Address Selector iPart displays the <strong>Account Profile</strong> page. 
	    			</li>
                <li>The <strong>Account Profile</strong> page is hardcoded to the content page "@/iMIS/ContactManagement/ContactLayouts/Account_Page". 
                    The URL parameter "AccountPages=Personal" is also passed.
				</li>
