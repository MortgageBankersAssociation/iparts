<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The iPart displays a conditional button to pay an outstanding renewal invoice. 
    When the user clicks the button, the renewal item is placed into the cart. Users do not have the option to selectively pay for individual line items within the invoice. 
        </li>
    
    <li class="v10only">The button displays only if the signed in user has an unpaid renewal invoice
        that is not already in the cart for items such as membership fees or subscriptions. </li>
    <li class="v10only"><b>Note for organizations that process renewal billings and use 
        accrual-based accounting</b>: Currently, this iPart can only be used to pay for 
        the most recently billed renewal invoice. Unpaid invoices for previously billed 
        renewal billings cannot be paid with this iPart. This may be an issue if your 
        organization has closely-recurring billing cycles, or if some of your users 
        renew multiple memberships through your organization and those memberships have 
        different billing cycles.</li>
        
    <li class="v100only">The button <em>displays</em> only if there is an outstanding invoice that is not already 
        in the cart for one of the following contacts:
        <ul>
                <li>The signed in user</li>
                <li>The contact currently selected as <strong>On Behalf Of</strong></li>
                <li>The contact whose record is being viewed (the button is disabled)</li>
                <li>The button is <em>enabled</em> only if the contact with the outstanding invoice is 
        signed in directly or <strong>On Behalf Of</strong>. Clicking the button adds the renewal to 
        the cart of that contact. If a page containing a contact key in the URL displays a contact that is 
        neither signed in nor selected for On Behalf Of, then the button is disabled. 
        For example, if Smith signs in and views the account for Jones (who has an outstanding renewal), 
        then the button is disabled until Smith acts on behalf of Jones.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="v100only">If users have more than one unpaid invoice, all invoices are added to the cart. 
        Users can select which invoices they want to pay from the cart. </li>
</ul>
