		<h1>Address Selector</h1>
		
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Name</strong> - Enter a name for the content item. This text appears during design mode (configuration).</li>

<li><strong>Title</strong> - Enter the text to display above this iPart on the rendered page. If blank, no title displays.</li>

<li><strong>Do not render in design mode</strong> - Select this option to prevent content record data from being loaded in the content editor. This improves performance during design time (configuration).</li>

<li><strong>Display a border around this content</strong> - Select this option to display a border around this iPart on the rendered page.</li>

			    <li>
					<strong>Address path</strong> - (required) Specify 
				    the SOA object for the address you want to display and control through this 
                    iPart.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>Cart.ShippingAddress</i> - the shipping address for the current cart.</li>
                        <li><i>Cart.CreditCardAddress</i> - the credit card billing address for the current cart.</li>
                        <li class="v10only"><i>Donation.CreditCardAddress</i> - the credit card billing address for the current donation.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Display button only</strong></li> - (Events only) To minimize the area that the iPart takes up in Event 
                    showcases, this option shows only a graphical button in place of the Address 
                    Selector's title (if any), address, and <u>Choose another address</u> link. The button 
                    opens the selector window. 
                <li><strong>Display registrant info in details</strong></li> - (Events only) Includes the registrant's informal name, title, and organization 
                    such as it will appear on event badges and reports. Note that this is 
                    event-specific information and not a mechanism for changing contact records.</ul>
		
		
		<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li> You can add this to a content record as a standalone iPart, but it is also 
                    included in other iParts to support address selection. For example,
                    <strong>ShippingMethodSelector</strong> incorporates this iPart and uses the<i> 
                    Cart.ShippingAddress</i> path to display and change the shipping address in the 
                    cart.</li>
                <li> The <strong>Manage addresses</strong> link displays the <strong>Account Profile</strong> page. The 
            <strong>Account Profile</strong> page is hardcoded to the content page "@/iMIS/ContactManagement/ContactLayouts/Account_Page". 
                    The URL parameter "AccountPages=Personal" is also passed.
</li>
 			</ul>
