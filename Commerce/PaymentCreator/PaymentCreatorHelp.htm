                    will be applied to the iPart at runtime. Add this CSS class to an appropriate

                around this iPart on the rendered page.</li>

                <li><b>Purpose</b> - This iPart can be used to accept payment details in a 
                    shopping cart or on a donation page. In both cases, use this iPart with other 
                    iParts to complete a transaction. Select a processing type that best fits your 
                    use of this iPart: 
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Cart</b> - Default; the order is submitted for processing from a shopping cart. </li>
                        <li><b>Donation</b> - Required to use this iPart in combination with the Donation 
                            Creator iPart, to create a standalone donation page.</li>
                    </ul>

                       <li class="v10only"><i>Exceptions:</i><ul>
                           <li>Do not select this option when the <b>Purpose = Donation</b>.</li>
                           <li>Do not select this option when enabling PayPal Express, which requires the <b>
                               Submit Order Button</b>.</li>
                           </ul>
                       </li>

                </li>
        
            <li><b>Commit sequence</b> - (required when <b>Purpose</b> = <b>Donation</b>)
                    Commit sequence affects how multiple iParts interact on a page. Enter a non-zero number 
                    to specify the order that changes are saved relative to other inline editable iParts on 
                    the rendered page. Zero (default) = save order is unimportant.</li>
            <li><b>Purchase order number required for Bill Me</b> - (active only if purchase orders are allowed; 
                   enabled by default) 
                Disable this option to allow shoppers to check out using <b>Bill Me</b> without 
                entering a Purchase Order number.</li>
        </ul>
                   
        <p><b>Notes</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users see the warning &quot;Invalid card number&quot; 
            if their entry fails the check digit algorithm for credit card verification. </li>
            <li>The address is passed to the card authorization gateway and may be used to validate 
                a credit card, depending on 
            the gateway provider. </li>
            <li><b>Donations:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Choosing addresses:</i> For credit and debit donations, the donor&#39;s name and 
                        address are passed to the card authorization gateway and may be used to validate 
                        the card. Only authenticated users see the link to <b>Choose another address</b>. 
                            Unauthenticated users (guests) must enter a valid address in the Contact 
                        Account Creator iPart, which is then used to validate the card. </li>
                    <li><i>Commit sequence: </i>A donation page that processes payments immediately 
                (instead of through the cart) must include the Payment Creator. Processing a 
                donation immediately requires the iParts to reside on the <em>same</em>
                content record, but they can display in any order. The <b>Commit sequence </b>values, not the placement order, control 
                        when 
                the iParts are processed. When the donation is submitted from the content 
                record, execution control is given to each iPart based on the <b>Commit sequence</b> 
                value shown in parentheses:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Donation Creator (2) </li>

                    <li><i>Choosing addresses</i>: Whether a user may choose another address when entering payment 
                    details depends on which <b>Purpose</b> has been selected:

                            <li>If <b>Purpose</b> = <b>Cart</b>, the <b>Choose another address</b> link will display.</li>

                            only if the user is logged on. Users who have not logged on must enter a valid

                        submit payment using the PayPal site. If you are designing your own check out pages, 
                        be sure that the <b>Payment Creator</b> and <b>Submit Order Button</b> iParts are on the same page.
