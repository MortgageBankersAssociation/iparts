                        System Administrators and Staff (Full and Casual users) can add members to a group. 
                        2) Only group members, System Administrators, and Staff can delete members from a group 
                        and edit 
                        membership information if available.</span></li>
                    <li><b>Button text for adding a contact</b> - Enter the text to display on the 
                        button a user clicks to add group members.</li>
                    <li><b>Mode</b> - Select a mode to specify how you want the iPart to function. The options 
                        available below the <b>Mode</b> section change depending on which mode you select. In 
                        each mode, the iPart uses the value of a URL parameter to generate the group 
                        list displayed to the user. By default, the iPart looks for a <b>UniformKey</b> 
                        or <b>iUniformKey</b> parameter value. If neither is available, the iPart uses the 
                        selected or logged in user as the <b>parent ID</b>. You can override the default 
                        behavior by specifying an alternate URL parameter that the iPart should use to 
                        generate the group list.&nbsp;
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Display a group&#39;s members and any sub-groups</b> - Select this mode to list a 
                        group&#39;s members and any sub-groups, if they exist. <span class="v100only">For example, enable this mode 
                        to display all members of a chapter and any committee groups within that 
                        chapter.</span><ul>
                                    <li><b>URL parameter for group ID </b>- Leave this field blank, unless you want to

                                    <li><b>Choose the group types to include</b> - The selected group types determine 
                                        which sub-groups are displayed in the initial list and in expanded contact 
                                        nodes. For example, if a chapter has both committee and club 
                        sub-groups, you can select one or both to be displayed within the iPart. </li>

                            <li><b>Display groups by parent ID</b> - Select this mode to list groups owned by a 
                                particular parent ID. If multiple groups are owned by the parent ID, initially 
                                only the groups are listed, but each group can be expanded to display 
                                members. If only a single group is owned by the parent ID, initially all of the 
                                group members are listed. <span class="v10only">For example, if you add the Group List Editor to an 
                                organization contact&#39;s account page, it will automatically display an organization roster 
                                (a group member list).</span> <span class="v100only">For example, if you add the Group List Editor to a 
                                Chapter's page, it will automatically list all of the groups owned by the Chapter, such as committees and clubs. But if 
                                the Chapter only has members and owns no other groups, then initially all of the Chapter members are displayed.</span>

                                Select this mode to only display groups of a single type. If a group of that 
                        type does not already exist, users can automatically create a new group by 
                        adding a member. For example, you can choose to only display a chapter&#39;s 
                        committees. If no committees exist yet, no groups are listed, but a user can 
                        click <b>add</b> to automatically create a committee and add members. When this mode is 
                        selected, the configuration option <b>Allow editing</b> is enabled, so that groups can 
                        be automatically created. Select this mode if you want to display an organization roster, so that 
                        the organization group can be auto-created when you add the first member.

		<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>A good use for this iPart is to add it to a page that already displays 
                    information about a contact, event, or some other type of group page. In most 
                    cases, the Group List Editor will detect the group, parent, or contact ID in the 
                    URL and display a group list in the mode you select. If you add the iPart to a 
                    group page, and a group list does not display as you would expect, check the URL 
                    of the web page to determine if it uses a URL parameter other than <b>UniformKey</b> or 
                    <b>iUniformKey</b>. 
                </li>
                <li class="v100only"> 
					You can create, edit, and delete group types, roles, and statuses 
                    from <b>Tools &gt; Setup &gt; Groups</b>. </li>
                <li> 
					                    You can hard code URL parameter values using a 
                    navigation item. From <b>Site designer &gt; Manage sitemaps</b>, create or edit a 
                    navigation item and in the <b>URL Parameters</b> field, enter a parameter name and 
                    value. For example, ID=123.</li>
