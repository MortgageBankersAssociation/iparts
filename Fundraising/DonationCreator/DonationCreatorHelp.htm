        <li class="v10only"><strong>Display the gift distribution description</strong> - If you want to display
            a detailed description of the donation&#39;s distribution on the rendered page, enable
            this checkbox. You can find your distribution codes and edit the descriptions in 
            iMIS Desktop from <strong>Fundraising &gt; Set up tables &gt; Distributions
                and premiums</strong>. </li>
        <li class="v100only"><strong>Display the Gift Item description</strong> - If you want to display
            a detailed description of the donation&#39;s description on the rendered page, enable
            this checkbox. You can edit the Gift Item descriptions from the <strong>Shop</strong>. Select the Gift Item, then click <strong>(Edit)</strong>. </li>
        <li><strong>Processing mode</strong> - Donations made through this iPart can be processed
            in one of two ways. Choose the option that best fits your use of this iPart.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Add donation to the cart</strong> - When selected, donations made through
                    this iPart are added as an item in the user&#39;s shopping cart. They can then check
                    out and pay for the donation as well as any other items in their cart.</li> 
                <li><strong>Process donation immediately</strong> - When selected, donations can be
                    processed and paid for without using the shopping cart. If this option is selected,
                    then other iParts need to be added to the content record, with the proper
                    <strong>Commit sequence</strong> (see below for details).
                    </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="v10only"><b>Distribution</b> -&nbsp; Donations made through your website must be 
            associated with a valid distribution code defined in iMIS. This code can be 
            specified in two ways.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Set the distribution by an ItemId URL parameter</b> - Indicates that the 
                    content record containing the Donation Creator will be dynamically populated 
                    based on the value of an ItemId parameter in the URL. If selected, you must pass 
                    a valid distribution code to your Donation Creator iPart using a relative link, 
                    absolute link, or navigation item. The URL parameter is <strong>ItemId=[Distribution code]</strong>.
            For example, if you want to create an absolute link to a donation page for the BLDG distribution,
            set the URL to <strong>http://mywebsite.com/donationpage.aspx?ItemId=BLDG</strong>. Or, 
                    if you want to assign that same parameter from the navigation item instead, 
                    enter <b>ItemId=BLDG</b> into the <b>URL Parameters</b> field. </li>
                <li><b>Select a distribution code </b>- Specifies a single distribution code to be 
                    used for any donations made from the iPart. If selected, this option overrides 
                    the value of <b>ItemId</b> parameters in the URL.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="v100only"><b>Gift Item</b> -&nbsp; Donations made through your website must be 
            associated with the <b>Item Code</b> of a <b>Gift Item</b> (create <b>Gift Item</b>&#39;s 
            from <b>Shop &gt; (Add)</b>). You can associate donations with the required <b>Item 
            Code</b> in two ways.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Set the Gift Item by an ItemId URL parameter</b> - Indicates that the 
                    content record containing the Donation Creator will be dynamically populated 
                    based on the value of an ItemId parameter in the URL. If selected, you must pass 
                    a valid <b>Item Code</b> to your Donation Creator iPart using a relative link, 
                    absolute link, or navigation item. The URL parameter is <strong>ItemId=[Item 
                    Code]</strong>.
            For example, if you want to create an absolute link to a donation page for the BLDG <b>
                    Gift Item</b>,
            set the URL to <strong>http://mywebsite.com/donationpage.aspx?ItemId=BLDG</strong>. Or, 
                    if you want to assign that same parameter from the navigation item instead, 
                    enter <b>ItemId=BLDG</b> into the <b>URL Parameters</b> field. </li>
                <li><b>Select a Gift Item </b>- Specifies a single <b>Gift Item</b> to be 
                    used for any donations made from the iPart. If selected, this option overrides 
                    the value of <b>ItemId</b> parameters in the URL.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Commit sequence</strong> - Allows you to explicitly define the execution 
            order of multiple iParts in a content record. The number in this field indicates the processing order for this iPart, relative to 
            the other iParts in the same content record.  The value must be 0 or greater.  
            You can leave the default value of 0 if the execution order of iParts is not 
            a concern. iParts with a value of 0 are processed <i>after</i> any other iParts 
            with a non-zero <strong>Commit sequence</strong> value that are 
            on the same content record.  
            <p>For example, processing a donation immediately requires that multiple iParts are defined in a single content record. 
                It does not matter the order in which the iParts are defined on the page. In 
                the scenario outlined below, where the Donation Creator is the first iPart 
                displayed on the page and the Submit Order Button Link is the last iPart 
                displayed, the <strong>Commit sequence</strong> value controls the order in which 
                the iParts are processed. When the donation is &quot;submitted&quot; from the 
                content record, execution control is given to each iPart based on the 
            <strong>Commit sequence</strong> value shown in parentheses:
                <ul>
                    <li>Donation Creator (2)</li>
                    <li>Contact Account Creator (1)</li>
                    <li>Payment Creator (3)</li>
                    <li>Submit Order Button Link (4 or 0)</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Item added message (Cart mode)</b> - Enter the message to display when a 
            donation is successfully added to a user&#39;s cart. This text is only displayed if 
            the iPart&#39;s <b>Processing mode</b> is <b>Add donation to the cart</b>. </li>
    </ul>
   <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li class="v10only">By default, the Donation Creator displays a single, empty <strong>
            Gift Amount</strong> field. However, you also have the option to display
            an array of gift amounts from which the user can select, or to display a single
            <strong>Gift Amount </strong>field that is pre-populated with
            a gift amount of your choice.
            To do either of these, first create a <strong>GIFT_AMOUNT</strong> table
            from <strong>iMIS Desktop &gt; Customers &gt; Set up tables &gt; General lookup/validation</strong>.
            In the <strong>Code</strong> field, enter the distribution code for which you want 
            to customize the display. For example, BLDG. The values you enter in the 
            <strong>Description</strong> field determine what is displayed on the donation webpage:
            <ul>
                <li>To display an array of gift amounts, enter a comma-separated list of gift values 
                    that you want to appear in the list. For example, entering 50,100,200,500 
                    results in a radio list of those values displayed on the page. To preselect an 
                    option, precede the number with an asterisk: 15,*25,75. The gift array always displays an option for the user to select <strong>Other</strong>
                    and enter any amount.</li>
                <li>To display a single <strong>Gift Amount</strong> field with a pre-populated gift amount, enter a 
                    single amount. For example, 25.</li>
            </ul>
