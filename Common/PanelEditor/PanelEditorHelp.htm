<h1>Panel Editor</h1>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Name</strong> - Enter a name for the content item. This text appears during design mode (configuration).</li>
    <li><strong>Title</strong> - Enter the text to display above this iPart on the rendered page. If blank, no title displays.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not render in design mode</strong> - Select this option to prevent content record data from being 
    loaded in the content editor. This improves performance during design time (configuration).</li>
    <li><strong>iPart CSS class</strong> - (optional) Enter the name of a CSS class that 
        will be applied to the iPart at runtime. Add this CSS 
        class to an appropriate style sheet. Using such classes lets you apply special 
        formatting to targeted iParts in a reusable way.</li>
    <li><strong>Display a border around this content - (required for 
        collapsible panels) Select this option to display a border around this iPart 
    on the rendered page. </strong></li>
    <li><strong>Display content within a collapsible panel</strong> - Enable to allow 
        users to minimize the panel within the page, to work with dense pages more efficiently.</li>
    <li><strong>Show the content as collapsed </strong>- Enable to display the panel 
                minimized by default. <i>Tip:</i> Be sure that the <strong>Title</strong> makes 
                clear what data is hidden from view.</li>
    <li class="v10only"><b>Display for authorized users only -</b> (enabled by default)
        Hides the iPart from public users when accessing data for another person, which
        prevents spoofing (changing the ID in the URL to access another&#39;s data). Disable
        this option if you need to make this iPart visible to public users, such as for
        a public profile. </li>
    <li class="v100only"><b>Display for authorized users only</b> - (enabled by default)
        Hides the iPart from public users when accessing data for another person, which
        prevents spoofing (changing the ID in the URL to access another&#39;s data). Disable
        this option if you need to make this iPart visible to public users, such as for
        a public profile. <b>Note:</b> This iPart may behave differently if you have edited
        the permissions defined in your <i>ClaimsMap.xml</i> and <i>ClaimTemplates.xml</i>
        files. By default, only System Administrators and members of the Staff Group have
        the claims to access data for any user in the system. </li>
    
    <li><strong>Panel</strong> - Select a pre-existing panel from the drop-down list, or create your own. 
       To add a new data source, see "<span class="C1HJump">Defining your own data with Panel Designer</span>"
                <span class="C1HManual">on the Helpsite.</span> <span class="v10only">If the <b>import</b> 
        button is displayed, you can click it to import panels generated from user 
        defined windows defined in iMIS Desktop. If the <b>import</b> button is not displayed, then no 
        new user defined windows are available for import.</span><em> Tip:</em> You do not have to republish the iPart to see panel changes; panels are stored separately from content records.<br />
    <em>Panel options:</em>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Panel name</strong> - Identify the panel for administrators; it does not appear on the displayed page.</li>
        <li><strong>Panel description</strong> - (optional) Explain the panel for administrators;  it does not appear on 
        the displayed page.</li>
        <li><strong>Show data sources...</strong> <em>radio buttons</em> - Specify whether you want to populate the panel 
        from single-instance (simple) tables, which is the default, or a multi-instance table. If you need data from a 
        multi-instance table, you must place it in a separate panel: a panel can only display a single multi-instance table  								at a time, by itself.</li>
        <li><strong>[<u>+</u>] [<u>-</u>]</strong> <i>far right</i> - (optional) Add/remove columns. Click the 
            plus-sign button to the right of the layout area to add up to two more columns. If the right-most column is empty 
            when you select <strong>OK</strong>, it is removed from the layout.</li>
            
        <li><strong>Layout area</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Label:</strong> Edit the default text for each field, to make it shorter or more user-friendly. 
            <i>Labeling is required:</i> If you delete the default label, the iPart uses the 
                underlying column name</li>
            <li><strong>Read-only</strong>: Enable on those fields for which you want to prevent user updates. This option 
            only applies if you have enabled <strong>Allow users to edit</strong> (below).</li>
            <li><strong>Hide in Summary View</strong>: Enable on non-critical fields that you want to make available only 
            in the full pop-up view.</li>
            <li><em>Tips:</em>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Double-clicking</em> adds a field to the first available space in your panel. 
                <em>Dragging</em> a field lets you place it elsewhere in the panel.</li>
                <li>Add one field by double-clicking, dragging, or clicking on the plus icon <strong>[+]</strong> 
                to the left of each node in the hierarchy. Each node is an available table, and its fields 
                expand below it. If you see no plus icon, all of its available fields are already added to your panel.</li>
                <li>Add a whole table by dragging or double-clicking a table name; if you have already added 
                fields from that table, the remaining fields will be added without duplication. Fields appear in the 
                first available space in your panel, until the space is used up.</li>
                <li>Add fields from <em>different</em> nodes to combine fields from different single-instance tables.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Arrange fields by dragging within the layout preview area. Leave empty cells where you want white 
                    space to appear within the panel.</li>
                <li>Remove field: click the <strong>X</strong> button after its name; it returns to the 
                    hierarchical control, from which you can select it again.</li>
                <li>Remove column: click the <strong>[<u>-</u>]</strong> button to the right of the layout area; 
                    it removes the right-most column. </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Enable scrolling for multi-instance panels</strong> - Select this checkbox to set a height and width for
        a multi-instance panel. If the panel exceeds the set dimensions scrolling is enabled.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Panel width</strong> - Enter the width in pixels.</li>
            <li><strong>Panel height</strong> - Enter the height in pixels.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>        
    <li><strong>Allow users to edit</strong> - Select this checkbox to enable people to 
        enter or change their current data; the option lets you set the size of the edit 
        window:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Edit window width</strong> - Enter the default width, 
        in pixels, of the pop-up edit window.</li>
            <li><strong>Edit window height</strong> - Enter the default height, 
        in pixels, of the pop-up edit window.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Refreshing other panels on the content record</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>You can connect panel-displaying iParts on the same content record so that they 
            dynamically refresh each other after user edits.</li>
        <li>To create a connection, edit the content record, select the <strong>Connect</strong> 
            option from the panel iPart&#39;s title bar menu, create an <strong>Object Consumer</strong> connection, 
            select a panel iPart from the <strong>Object Provider</strong><em> </em>drop-list, and 
            select <strong>Connect</strong>. </li>
        <li>For details, see "<span class="C1HJump">Connecting iParts to refresh panels</span>"
            <span class="C1HManual"> on the Helpsite</span></li>.
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Adding existing business objects</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Panel Designer lets you create new data sources on the fly, but it can also display 
                existing business objects that have a <strong>ContactKey</strong> or <strong>ID</strong> property.</li>
            <li>For details, see "<span class="C1HJump">Adding existing business objects to panels</span>"
                <span class="C1HManual">on the Helpsite</span></li>.
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="v10only"><strong>General Lookup Tables</strong>: When lookup tables, such as PREFIX, have fields 
    with duplicated values, such as EXPANSION, SOA ignores these duplicate values. The Panel Editor stores the value for 
    CODE and displays the value for DESCRIPTION.</li>
    <li><strong>Single-instance</strong> tables may have multiple entries, but they allow only one entry per instance 
    of a parent object.</li>
    </ul>
